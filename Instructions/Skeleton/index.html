					Most individuals in Western society will say that they exercise at least once a month. Indeed, above 50% of individuals in the United States and Puerto Rico that were surveyed in 2014 by the Blahblahblah survey system said they had exercised at least once that month. Surprisingly(or maybe not too surprising) a negative correlation could be found between the percentage of people who said they had exercised at least once that month and the poverty rate within their state. The higher the poverty rate, the less likely someone would say that they had exercised at least once that month. Perhaps this is likely due to what type of jobs the working poor are doing, or it could be the amount of time that was spent outside of work. Which often those who have less money, also have less time. Further research may find that certain policies in different states and territories are affecting the amount of times people are able to exercise in a month.
